        <p> <b>First Post:</b> The section that caught my attention was the "Stone Soup 
            and Boiled Frogs" section because I thought that it was 
            a super bizzare title but then it actually was a relatable paragraph
            that I can utilize in my future projects. The story about the soldiers 
            and the vilagers did not seem like it would be something that I would
            be able to relate to my life, but after the section got to its point, 
            I saw the importance of proving your worth before you can get everyone's support. 
            Even thgouh you are able to see the entire project from the start, people tent to respond better to
            visual progress rather than big promises. Once you have delivered some progress and 
            shown some proof that what you what to do is possible, then others will be more willing
            to hop onto your ideas and follow your lead. This theory can be applied to many other
            types of colaborative project-like work which is another reason why I found this sections 
            interesting. </p>

        <p> <b>Second Post:</b> In chapter two of <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>, the part that interested me 
            the most was the section about project teams. Over the winter I was lucky to be a part of this video game
            design internship where I was the leader of my team and managed my teamates. 
            This section in the book reminded me of this internship because I had to figure out what the best way to 
            do this project with a group of people was. We had 2 programmers, 2 artists, 1 3D modeler,
            1 sound designer, and a game desogner. Everyone was specialized in thier own feild and where
            completly capable of doing thier tasks, all that was needed to be done was assigning those 
            tasks and making sure that no one was overlapping in work and making sure that two people 
            were not doing the same thing at the same time. I would consistantly hold full team meetings 
            twice a week so that everyone in the group would be up to date with all of the big work that 
            everyone has been working on and then I would set up smaller meeting with indeviduals to discuss 
            details about the specific things that they were working on. The section in this chapter is all about 
            how to ensure that the team is working together and efficiently so that everyone meets the goal 
            as soon as possible and with minimal problems. I think that some of 
            the main qualities to have in a group in order for it to function properly
            is trust in each team member, constant communication to each team member (even if you think that it does not directly effect them), 
            and critical honestly in a colaborative manor. Team member should be honest and give feedback 
            in a way where teamates can improove thier work for the better.
            It was the section that caught my eye the most because of my real-world connection to it.</p>
