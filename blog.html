        <p> <b>First Post:</b>The section that caught my attention was the "Stone Soup 
            and Boiled Frogs" section because I thought that it was 
            a super bizzare title but then it actually was a relatable paragraph
            that I can utilize in my future projects. The story about the soldiers 
            and the vilagers did not seem like it would be something that I would
            be able to relate to my life, but after the section got to its point, 
            I saw the importance of proving your worth before you can get everyone's support. 
            Even thgouh you are able to see the entire project from the start, people tent to respond better to
            visual progress rather than big promises. Once you have delivered some progress and 
            shown some proof that what you what to do is possible, then others will be more willing
            to hop onto your ideas and follow your lead. This theory can be applied to many other
            types of colaborative project-like work which is another reason why I found this sections 
            interesting. </p>
